# my-learnings
A repository to collect all my C++ learnings and practice codes.

Starting right from the basics and would try documenting it too.

## STL(Standard Template Library)
Basically, it's a set of templates which makes our code simple and easy to write.
For eg: Swapping of 2 elements.

without STL: 
t=a;
a=b;
b=t;

with STL;
swap(a,b);

To use STL:
just write this at the very start of the code:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
